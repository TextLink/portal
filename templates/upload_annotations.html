    TextLink will unify numerous but scattered linguistic resources on discourse structure. Effective discourse in
    any language is characterized by clear relations between sentences and coherent structure. But languages vary in
    how relations and structure are signalled. While monolingual dictionaries and grammars can characterise the
    words and sentences of a language and bilingual dictionaries can do the same between languages, there is nothing
    similar for discourse. For discourse, however, discourse-annotated corpora are becoming available in individual
    languages.
    <br>
    <br>
    The TextLink Action will facilitate European multilingualism by (1) identifying and creating a portal into such
    resources within Europe â€œincluding annotation tools, search tools, and discourse-annotated corpora; (2) delineating
    the dimensions and properties of discourse annotation across corpora; (3) organising these properties into a
    sharable taxonomy; (4) encouraging the use of this taxonomy in subsequent discourse annotation and in cross-lingual
    search and studies of devices that relate and structure discourse; and (5) promoting use of the portal, its
    resources and sharable taxonomy. With partners from across Europe, TextLink will unify numerous but scattered
    linguistic resources on discourse structure. With its resources searchable by form and/or meaning and a source of
    valuable correspondences, TextLink will enhance the experience and performance of human translators, lexicographers,
    language technology and language learners alike.

    Currently TextLink has over 150 members from across our 26 member countries and 2 International Partner Countries,
    contributing to 4 working groups. The Action is funded by Cost (www.cost.eu), a European framework that supports
    trans-national cooperation among researchers, engineers and scholars across Europe. The TextLink Action will run
    from 11 April 2014 to 10 April 2018.
